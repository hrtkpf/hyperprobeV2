/*
 * druncheck.c: this test case is a check against CVE-2009-3722.
 * CVE-2009-3722: in kvm code, between kernel version 2.6.20 and 2.6.31,
 * the kvm do not check privilege level when a program is accessing dr registers.
 * This may leads to a privilege escalation attack. And this has been fixed in kernel 2.6.32.
